# Panorama Typed

Near-full coverage of Panorama's APIs and data structures with Typescript definitions. These types are modeled after Strata Source's Panorama APIs. While it is possible to use these types with CS:GO and other games, some things may not match up.

Features:
- Inline documentation and cited examples for some (mostly unclear) functions.
- Smart type returns for panel-related functions.
- Smart type checking for built-in events.

*Warning: This is a work-in-progress, and type definitions are subject to change at any time.*
